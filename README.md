# Rust Study Group for Blockchain - Winter 2025

## Overview

The Rust Study Group for Blockchain - Winter 2025 is designed to help university students interested in blockchain, particularly in zero-knowledge proofs, build a solid foundation in Rust. 
Many students lack practical experience with Rust during the semester, making it challenging to engage in blockchain-related development. 
This study program provides an opportunity to learn Rust fundamentals and explore how it can be applied to blockchain.

## Study Program
This program is focused on learning Rust fundamentals and understanding its practical applications. 
Participants will engage in structured activities designed to reinforce their knowledge and improve their confidence in Rust development.

### **Main Activities:**
1. **Weekly Team Presentations** – Each week, two pre-assigned teams present on their designated Rust topics.
2. **Rustlings Exercises** – Participants individually solve [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises to strengthen their Rust programming skills.
3. **Mini (Toy) Project (TBD)** – In the final stage, participants may develop and present a small Rust project, depending on group consensus.

**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Starting**: First week of January 2025

### Curriculum

Each week, one or two teams will present topics, starting from the 2nd week.
